## Project Name
LeetCode Algorithms
## About
This repository contains implementations of common algorithms focused on string and array manipulations, including substring search, longest common prefix, element removal, Roman numeral conversion, and parentheses validation. It serves as a personal learning resource and portfolio showcase for algorithmic problem-solving concepts.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need Go and TypeScript installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This Algorithms project includes these features:

-Substring search (strStr) using sliding window approach

-Longest common prefix finding via sorting and comparison

-In-place element removal with two pointers

-Roman numeral to integer conversion using mapping

-Parentheses validation with stack data structure

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/DataStructures.git`

## Usage
Run the Go script (strstr.go) or TypeScript script (longest_common_prefix.ts) from the command line: 

`go run strstr.go `

or 

`ts-node longest_common_prefix.ts`
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand sliding window and substring comparison for search problems

-Apply sorting and character-by-character comparison for prefix matching

-Implement two-pointer techniques for in-place array modifications

-Use maps for value lookups in conversion algorithms

-Utilize stacks for matching and validation problems like parentheses

## Contributing
